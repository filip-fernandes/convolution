# convolution
Implementation of convolutional layers.

I wrote this convolutional layer and convolutional network as an introduction to computer vision and applying deep learning to process and analyze graphical data. The layer I created is similar to the torch.nn.Conv2d, as shown in the ConvoNet file.<br> Doing it for RGB images was challenging, and I ended up learning a lot about how to manipulate tensors and how images are processed in convolutional layers.
